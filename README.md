# Hi there, I'm Denislav ðŸ‘‹

My task is to show more/less information for the selected article.

ðŸ”‘ By clicking the [More] button for the selected article, it reveals the content of a hidden div and changes the text of the button to [Less].

The content is obtained by making a GET request to the server. When the same button is clicked again (now reading Less),

the div is hid and the text of the button will be changed to More. Link action is toggleable (you should be able to click the button infinite amount of times).


ðŸ“Œ IMPORTANT ðŸ“Œ
To start the project you have to start the server

with the command in the terminal- node server.js,

and open it with live server.
